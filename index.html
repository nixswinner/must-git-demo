    <h1>Introduction to Git</h1>
    <p>Git is a powerful and widely used version control system that helps developers manage their codebase efficiently. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a complete history of your project's development.</p>

    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system, which means that each developer has a complete copy of the project's repository on their local machine. This allows for offline work and efficient collaboration among team members.</p>

    <h2>Why Use Git?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Track changes: Git keeps a detailed record of every change made to your codebase, making it easy to revert to a previous version if needed.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with others: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, merging their changes together seamlessly.</li>
        <li>Branching and merging: Git makes it easy to create branches for new features or bug fixes, and then merge those changes back into the main codebase when ready.</li>
        <li>Distributed workflow: With Git, developers can work on their local copies of the repository and synchronize their changes with a remote server or other developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started with Git</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Install Git on your machine from the official website: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
        <li>Configure Git with your name and email address:
            <pre><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory:
            <pre><code>git init</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Start tracking your files by adding them to the staging area:
            <pre><code>git add .</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
            <pre><code>git commit -m "Initial commit"</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is just the beginning! There's much more to learn about Git, including branching, merging, working with remote repositories, and collaborating with others. Keep exploring and practicing with Git to become proficient in version control.</p>
